# FTC-Rover-Ruckus

Hello,

Me and my classmates started Filatronics, a robotic team, in 2018. We started it as a new challenge for our high school, as there hadn't been a team on this domain before.
Competition that we took part was the First Tech Challenge, organised by BRD in our country and the name of the game was Rover Ruckus.

I have attached our team's codes, 1 robot teleop, 2 autonomous codes, one for depot, one for crater and the hardware code.
